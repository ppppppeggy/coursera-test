      <h3>Chicken</h3>
      INGREDIENTS
      For The Chicken:
      4 chicken breasts (pounded 1/2-inch thin)
      2 teaspoons each of onion powder and garlic powder
      1 teaspoon fresh chopped parsley
      1/2 teaspoon each of dried thyme and dried rosemary*
      salt and pepper , to season
      For The Sauce:
      4 cloves garlic , minced (or 1 tablespoon minced garlic)
      1 teaspoon fresh chopped parsley
      1/2 teaspoon each of dried thyme and dried rosemary
      1 cup milk (or half and half)*
      Salt and freshly ground black pepper , to taste
      1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water , until smooth
      INSTRUCTIONS
      Coat chicken breasts with the onion and garlic powders and herbs. Season generously with salt and pepper.
      Heat 1 tablespoon of oil a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken breasts until opaque and no longer pink inside (about 5 minutes each side, depending on thickness). Transfer to a plate; set aside.
      To the same pan or skillet, heat another 2 teaspoons of olive oil and sauté garlic, with parsley, thyme and rosemary, for about 1 minute, or until fragrant.
      Stir in milk (or cream); season with salt and pepper, to taste.
      Bring to a boil; add the cornstarch mixture to the centre of the pan, quickly stirring, until sauce has thickened slightly. Reduce heat and simmer gently for a further minute to allow the sauce to thicken more.
      Return chicken to the skillet. Sprinkle with extra herbs if desired. Serve immediately.
      NOTES
      *If you don't like Thyme or Rosemary, substitute these with Basil and Oregano, or use Tarragon.**For a dairy free option, I find Cashew milk the best in flavour. You can also use almond milk or rice milk. Yes, heavy cream can be substituted!

      <h3>Beef</h3>
      Step 1
      Place garlic cloves in a food processor, and process until almost a paste, about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Add shallot, rosemary, thyme, chives, anchovies, 1 tablespoon of the salt, and 2 teaspoons of the pepper to food processor. Pulse until shallot is finely chopped, about 5 pulses. Add butter, and process until combined, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Transfer half of butter mixture to a sheet of parchment paper; gently roll and shape into a log; refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 3 days. Let remaining butter mixture stand at room temperature up to 4 hours, or transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days; let come to room temperature before continuing.
      Step 2
      Season rib-eye roast evenly with remaining 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Using a spatula, spread butter mixture in bowl evenly over rib-eye roast, and transfer roast to a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Add 4 cups of the beef broth to roasting pan. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
      Step 3
      Preheat oven to 450°F. Roast rib roast in preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Without opening oven door, reduce oven temperature to 325°F, and continue roasting until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of roast registers 130°F, about 1 hour and 40 minutes to 2 hours, occasionally checking liquid level in the bottom of roasting pan, and adding remaining 2 cups broth as needed to maintain a depth of at least 1/4 inch. Transfer rib-eye roast to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes.
      Step 4
      Meanwhile, pour juices from roasting pan through a fine mesh strainer into a medium saucepan; discard solids. Bring to a simmer over low, skimming and discarding fat as it develops on the surface. Whisk together cornstarch and 3 tablespoons of simmering beef juices in a small bowl until smooth. Whisk cornstarch mixture into juices in saucepan, and continue simmering, whisking constantly, until sauce is thickened and coats back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat, and cover to keep warm.
      Step 5
      Slice rib-eye roast against the grain into 1- to 1 1/2-inch-thick slices, and arrange on plates. Top each slice evenly with gravy mixture, 1/2-inch-thick rounds of chilled reserved compound butter, thinly sliced chives, flaky sea salt, and 2 or 3 grinds of pepper; serve immediately.

      <h3>Sushi</h3>
      Prep all of your ingredients. First things first, make your sushi rice ideally at least an hour or two in advance so that it has time to cool to room temperature before assembling your rolls. Then go ahead and prep all of your other ingredients so that you can have a nice assembly line ready to go for your rolls.
      Press the rice. Then, begin your assembly! The first step will be to press the rice onto your sheet of nori in an even layer, leaving a 1-inch empty border of nori at the top. (See photos above.)
      Add the fillings. Next, layer on your fillings horizontally on the rice, side by side, as evenly as possible.
      Roll up the sushi. Lift up the bottom edge of the sushi mat and carefully fold it over the fillings until they are enclosed in a roll, yet still leaving the top 1-inch of the empty nori exposed. Use the sushi mat to squeeze the roll in as tightly as possible. (Although not too tight, as you don’t want all of the fillings to squish out!)  Dip your fingers in the water bowl once more and use them to wet the remaining 1-inch of nori. Then use the sushi mat to finish rolling up the roll until it is completely enclosed, giving it a final squeeze or two once it has been rolled up to be sure that everything is packed in there tightly. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
      Cut the sushi. Using a very sharp knife, cut the each sushi roll into 8 equal(ish)-sized pieces on a cutting board. Transfer them to your serving plate.
      Drizzle and garnish. Drizzle the sushi with the spicy mayo and/or sprinkle with extra toasted sesame seeds.
      Serve. Serve immediately, along with pickled ginger, wasabi paste, and soy sauce for dipping. And enjoy!
